- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sarit-chaet-hudis
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m still exploring interesting directions in which I can learn, develop and implement projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python: 
- (done!) https://campus.gov.il/course/course-v1-tau-acd_tau_cs101x/
- (done!) pre-course: https://www.itc.tech/full-stack-development/
- (more than half-way through) https://campus.gov.il/course/course-v1-cs-gov-cs-nextpy102/
- planning on:
- https://www.edx.org/school/gtx 
- pluralsight scaling python
- trying out blockchain https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/ethereum-blockchain-development/

- ðŸŽ® I like to practice on CodeWars when I'm not completing some course or tutorial :)
